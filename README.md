## Requirements
----------------

- iOS 9.0+
- Xcode 10+
- Swift 4, 4.1, 4.2 and Swift 5


## Usage
----------------
Add it to your project, and that's all! **Shake your device** or your simulator and Wormholy will appear! You don't need to import the library into your code, it works magically!

I suggest you install it only in debug mode. The easiest way is with CocoaPods:

```
pod 'Wormholy', :configurations => ['Debug']
``` 


If you want to disable the shake, and fire Wormholy from another point inside your app, you need to set the [environment variable](https://medium.com/@derrickho_28266/xcode-custom-environment-variables-681b5b8674ec) `WORMHOLY_SHAKE_ENABLED` = `NO`, and call this local notification:

```
NotificationCenter.default.post(name: NSNotification.Name(rawValue: "wormholy_fire"), object: nil)
```

You can also programmatically enable/disable the shake gesture at any time. You can do `Wormholy.shakeEnabled = false` to disable (or enable) the shake gesture. 



## Carthage
----------------

You can also install Wormholy using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).

To integrate Wormholy into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "pmusolino/Wormholy"
```
Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `Wormholy.framework` into your Xcode project.
