## Requirements

- iOS 16.0+ (Need an older version? [Please use version 1.7.x](https://github.com/pmusolino/Wormholy/releases/tag/1.7.0))
- Xcode 15+
- Swift 5

## Usage

Integrating Wormholy into your project is simple, and it works like magic! **Shake your device** or simulator to access Wormholy. There's no need to import the library into your code.

<u>**It is recommended to install it only in debug mode and not integrate it into production. Please remove it before sending your apps to production.**</u> The easiest way to do this is with CocoaPods:

```shell
pod 'Wormholy', :configurations => ['Debug']
```

You can also integrate Wormholy using the **Swift Package Manager**!

### Configuration Options

- **Ignored Hosts**: Specify hosts to be excluded from logging using `Wormholy.ignoredHosts`. This is useful for ignoring traffic to certain domains.
- **Logging Limit**: Control the number of logs retained with `Wormholy.limit`. This helps manage memory usage by limiting the amount of data stored.
- **Default Filter**: Set a default filter for the search box with `Wormholy.defaultFilter` to streamline your debugging process.
- **Enable/Disable**: Use `Wormholy.setEnabled(_:)` to toggle request tracking globally. You can also enable or disable it for specific `URLSessionConfiguration` instances using `Wormholy.setEnabled(_:sessionConfiguration:)`.
- **Shake Gesture**: Control the activation of Wormholy via shake gesture with `Wormholy.shakeEnabled`.

### Triggering Wormholy

If you prefer not to use the shake gesture, you can disable it using the [environment variable](https://medium.com/@derrickho_28266/xcode-custom-environment-variables-681b5b8674ec) `WORMHOLY_SHAKE_ENABLED` = `NO`.

To trigger Wormholy manually from another point in your app without using the shake gesture, call:

```swift
NotificationCenter.default.post(name: NSNotification.Name(rawValue: "wormholy_fire"), object: nil)
```

By following these steps and configurations, you can effectively integrate Wormholy into your development workflow, enhancing your ability to debug network requests efficiently.
